# LUNOS Heat Recovery Ventilation for Home Assistant

# ***NOT YET IMPLEMENTED***

Provides control of [LUNOS Heat Recovery Ventilation fans](https://foursevenfive.com/blog/lunos-faq/) (e2/eGO) using pairs of smart on/off relays. Per the design of the LUNOS low-voltage fan controller, a pair of switches (W1/W2) are used to turn on/off the fans and set the speed settings by setting the switches to specific combinations. See the LUNOS installation details for more information on [how the LUNOS wall switches are installed](https://youtu.be/wQxiYQebs10?t=418).

## Installation

Visit the Home Assistant community if you need [help with installation and configuration of LUNOS Fan Control]().

### Step 1: Install Custom Components

Easiest installation is by setting up [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs), and then adding the "Integration" repository: rsnodgrass/hass-lunos.

However you can also manually copy all the files in [lunos/](https://github.com/rsnodgrass/hass-lunos/custom_components/lunos) directory to `/config/custom_components/lunos` on your Home Assistant installation.

### Step 2: Configure Fans and Assign Control Switch Pairs

LUNOS Controllers require a pair of switches (W1 and W2) to control the speed of the fans (as well as other features).
Configuration is required to assign the Home Assistant accessible W1 and W2 switches for the fan controller to use
in operating the LUNOS fan controller.

Configuration variables:
- **name** (*Optional*): The name of this fan controller.
- **relay_w1** (*Required*): The entity id for the relay switch that is connected as W1 to the LUNOS controller.
- **relay_w2** (*Required*): The entity id for the relay switch that is connected as W2 to the LUNOS controller.
- **controller_coding** (*Optional*): The tag for the LUNOS coding your controller is set to (see lunos-codings.yaml).
- **fan_count** (*Optional*): The number of fans connected to this LUNOS controller.
- **default_speed** (*Optional*): The default speed when this LUNOS fan is turned on without any speed indicated.

#### Configuration Example

This example configuration assumes that the relay switches are already setup in Home Assistant, since that
setup differs substantially depending on the type of relay hardware being used (e.g. Tasmota MQTT vs WeMo Maker).

```yaml
fan:
  - platform: lunos
    name: Bedroom Ventilation
    relay_w1: switch.lunos_bedrooms_w1
    relay_w2: switch.lunos_bedrooms_w2
  
  - platform: lunos
    name: Basement Ventilation
    controller_coding: e2-usa
    entity: fan.lunos_basement_ventilation
    relay_w1: switch.lunos_basement_w1
    relay_w2: switch.lunos_basement_w2

  - platform: lunos
    name: Bathroom Fan
    default_speed: high
    controller_coding: ego
    relay_w1: switch.lunos_bathroom_w1
    relay_w2: switch.lunos_bathroom_w2
```

### Step 3: Add Lovelace Card

The following is a simple Lovelace card using the [fan-control-entity-row](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/lovelace-fan-control-entity-row/102952):

```yaml
- entity: fan.lunos_bathroom
  type: custom:fan-control-entity-row
```

### Automation Examples

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Turn on LUNOS ventilation fans on when we get home"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: group.people
        to: "home"
    action:
      - service: fan.turn_on
        entity_id: "fan.lunos"
        data:
          speed: "high"
```

## Hardware

* LUNOS e2 HRV fan pairs or [LUNOS eGO HRV fan](https://foursevenfive.com/blog/introducing-the-lunos-ego/)
* LUNOS Universal Controller
* Home Assistant compatible relay

The LUNOS Universal Controller (5/UNI-FT) is powered by a 12V transformer (e.g. the Mean Well #RS-15-12 12V/1.3A/15.6W).
If you want to power two independent LUNOS Controllers and fan sets (plus powering a ESP8266 based WiFi relay),
it is recommended the 12V transformer be upgraded to a larger unit, like the Mean Well #RS-50-12 transformer,
which produces up to 50W at 12V.

#### WiFi Smart Relays

IMPORTANT: The pair of smart switches CANNOT be 120V switches as they MUST NOT be connected to any power source.
For non-smart installations, the LUNOS Universal Controller typically has non-electrified rocker switches connected
as switche W1 and W2. These are relay switches only and not powered. Any smart switches connected the LUNOS Universal
Controller must be relay switches only with no chance that the LUNOS Controller would be electrified.

While single-channel WiFi relays can be purchased, for centralized control of several LUNOS zones (using
several LUNOS Controllers), purchasing multi-relay modules typically costs less than separate single-channel relays.

Example relays compatible with Home Assistant:

| Model | Relays | Tasmota Supported | Manual Buttons | Power |
|-------|:------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|-------|
| [WiFi Relay Switch Module](https://amazon.com/Channel-Momentary-Inching-Self-Locking-Control/dp/B08211H51X/?tag=rynoshark-20) | 4 | Y | Y | 5V USB |
| [MHCOZY 4-channel WiFI wireless switch](https://amazon.com/Channel-Momentary-Inching-Self-lock-Controller/dp/B071KFX63R/?tag=rynoshark-20) | 4 | Y | N | 5-32V |
| [LC Technology 4X WiFi Relay (12V ESP8266)](https://www.banggood.com/DC12V-ESP8266-Four-Channel-Wifi-Relay-IOT-Smart-Home-Phone-APP-Remote-Control-Switch-p-1317255.html) | 4 | Y | N | 12V |

#### Tasmota Setup

After flashing your multi-channel WiFi relay with Sonoff, you must connect to it via the Sonoff WiFi
to access the Sonoff web configuration interface.

* configure the Sonoff relay device to connect to your WiFi network
* enable auto-discovery (for automatic Home Assistant integration)
* configure the MQTT broker host/user/password that your Home Assistant instance uses
* configure the [Tasmota switches](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/wiki/Buttons-and-switches)

In the Sonoff web interface Console, turn on auto discovery (option 19) so Home Assistant can find your relays:

```
SetOption19 on
```

Then you must configure in Sonoff web interface the address and username/password for the
MQTT broker that Home Assistant uses.

#### Example Wiring with ESP8266 WiFi Relay

The following is an example connecting a [LC Technology 12V ESP8266 Four-Channel WiFi Relay](https://www.banggood.com/DC12V-ESP8266-Four-Channel-Wifi-Relay-IOT-Smart-Home-Phone-APP-Remote-Control-Switch-p-1317255.html) to the LUNOS Controller.

### Wireless and Alexa Integration

For a clean LUNOS installation, assigning a [Lutron Cas√©ta Pico Fan Speed Controller](http://www.lutron.com/TechnicalDocumentLibrary/Caseta_Fan_Control_Sell_Sheet.pdf) (PD-FSQN-WH-R) to a LUNOS fan within Home Assistant allows extremely slick and simple control of a LUNOS fan in a single gang outlet box in an occupied space. The larger W1 and W2 control switches can then be "hidden" in a utility room or closet.

Additionally, once added to Home Assistant, LUNOS fan speeds can be configured to be controlled by
Alexa or other voice enabled smart speaker.
