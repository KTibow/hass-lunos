# LUNOS Heat Recovery Ventilation for Home Assistant

***NOT YET IMPLEMENTED***

Provides control of [LUNOS Heat Recovery Ventilation fans](https://foursevenfive.com/blog/lunos-faq/) (e2/eGO) using pairs of smart on/off relays. Per the design of the LUNOS low-voltage fan controller, a pair of relay switches (W1/W2) are used to turn on/off the fans and set the speed settings by setting the switches to specific combinations. See the LUNOS installation details for more information on [how the LUNOS wall switches are installed](https://youtu.be/wQxiYQebs10?t=418).

## Supported Smart Relays

IMPORTANT: The pair of smart switches CANNOT be 120V switches as they MUST NOT be connected to any power source.
For non-smart installations, the LUNOS Universal Controller typically has non-electrified rocker switches connected
as switche W1 and W2. These are relay switches only and not powered. Any smart switches connected the LUNOS Universal
Controller must be relay switches only with no chance that the LUNOS Controller would be electrified.

### Recommended Smart Relay

The [Belgin WeMo Maker](https://www.belkin.com/uk/p/P-F7C043/) (F7C043) is the recommended option for novices as it
is UL-listed, uses standard power adapter that plugs into any wall outlet, keeps 120V circuit completely
separate from the relay side (since it is powered by a 5V/1A micro USB cable), and communicates over WiFi
Since the WeMo Maker is powered by a 5V/1A micro USB cable, no electrical inspection should be required for the
install and wiring of this to a LUNOS Universal Controller.

Two WeMo Makers are required. The WeMo relay contacts should be connected to the LUNOS Universal Controller as
shown in the following diagram and with the switch type configured in WeMo software to be in Toggle mode.

### Advanced Relays (Electricans Only)

To meet code requirements, 120V circuits must be separated from any low-voltage circuit. These approaches are for advanced users only:

* [Tuya Wi-Fi Switch Module Relay](https://smile.amazon.com/Momentary-Inching-Self-Locking-90-264V-Compatible/dp/B07ZV73ZV7/) with L(out) and first relay contact wire nut connected as W1 or W2 to LUNOS Controller
* Intermatic PE635 allows 120V controller to switch separate low-voltage circuits (notably circuit 5 (and circuits 3 or 4 if wired as low-voltage, though must have a low-voltage divider insert fabricated).

### Wireless and Alexa Integration

For a clean LUNOS installation, assigning a [Lutron Cas√©ta Pico Fan Speed Controller](http://www.lutron.com/TechnicalDocumentLibrary/Caseta_Fan_Control_Sell_Sheet.pdf) (PD-FSQN-WH-R) to a LUNOS fan within Home Assistant allows extremely slick and simple control of a LUNOS fan in a single gang outlet box in an occupied space. The larger W1 and W2 control switches can then be "hidden" in a utility room or closet.

Additionally, once added to Home Assistant, LUNOS fan speeds can be configured to be controlled by
Alexa or other voice enabled smart speaker.

## Installation

Visit the Home Assistant community if you need [help with installation and configuration of LUNOS Fan Control]().

### Step 1: Install Custom Components

Easiest installation is by setting up [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs), and then adding the "Integration" repository: rsnodgrass/hass-lunos.

However you can also manually copy all the files in [lunos/](https://github.com/rsnodgrass/hass-lunos/custom_components/lunos) directory to `/config/custom_components/lunos` on your Home Assistant installation.

### Step 2: Configure Fans

Example configuration:

```yaml
lunos:
  - name: "Bedroom Ventilation"
    relay_w1: switch.lunos_bedrooms_w1
    relay_w2 switch.lunos_bedrooms_w2
  - name: "Basement Ventilation"
    entity: fan.lunos_basement_ventilation
    relay_w1: switch.lunos_basement_w1
    relay_w2 switch.lunos_basement_w2
  - name: "Bathroom Fan"
    default_speed: high
    relay_w1: switch.lunos_bathroom_w1
    relay_w2: switch.lunos_bathroom_w2
```

### Step 3: Add Lovelace Card

The following is a simple Lovelace card using the [fan-control-entity-row](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/lovelace-fan-control-entity-row/102952):

```yaml
- entity: fan.lunos_bathroom
  type: custom:fan-control-entity-row
```

### Automation Examples

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Turn on LUNOS ventilation fans on when we get home"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: group.people
        to: "home"
    action:
      - service: fan.turn_on
        entity_id: "fan.lunos"
        data:
          speed: "high"
```
